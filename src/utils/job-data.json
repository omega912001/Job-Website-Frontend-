      "description": "The Opportunity\nWe are investing in a Growth Engineering team at Postman to help developers and teams onboard to a powerful product experience that starts with single-player developers, and grows into teams that collaborate on the artifact of the APIs like how teams collaborate with the artifact of a design file using Figma. We are building this team for a number of reasons, notably\n...\nOptimize sign-up and onboarding experience for both individuals and teams\nHelp users uncover the power of Postman (it’s so much more than “just” an API client), gradually and at the right moment\nGuide users to key activation moments (like creating their first collection, or inviting a member to their team) that lead to expansion and a stickier product experience\n\nIn effect: we know we have a product experience and funnel that works quite well. Now we want to optimize, tune, and make it even more amazing (and measure even more). We’re looking for an experienced engineer who has worked on projects that generated measurable business impact. You’ll work closely with Postman’s engineering leadership and our product and design teams to achieve our mission of connecting 100M developers in the world. We specifically hope this person is you, because while the team is small right now, we want an eager, curious engineer who cares about building experiences that delight, convert, and measurably impact the business and work with a team of like-minded individuals who care deeply, too.\nWe have built a ubiquitous, loved developer product and you’d be joining the solid and growing team in the United States. If you’re curious, see why I joined and hear about my experience in joining the rocket ship of an opportunity that is Postman.\nWho are we\nPostman is the world’s leading API platform, used by more than 30 million developers and 500,000 organizations, including 98% of the Fortune 500. Postman is helping developers and professionals across the globe build the API-first world by simplifying each step of the API lifecycle and streamlining collaboration—enabling users to create better APIs, faster.\nThe company is headquartered in San Francisco and has an office in Bangalore, where it was founded. Postman is privately held, with funding from Battery Ventures, BOND, Coatue, CRV, Insight Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Learn more at postman.com or connect with Postman on Twitter via @getpostman.\nP.S: We highly recommend reading The \"API-First World\" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture and our vision at Postman.\nWhat you’ll do\nTo achieve our goals, we’ll need a talented, experienced, and thoughtful engineer with a special interest and aptitude for growth. We are looking for someone who cares deeply about the details and spends time building user interfaces that delight users. We need an engineer who can be somewhat self-directed and who has great taste, judgment, and can iterate (and ship!) quickly to achieve the iterative improvements to our first-time user experience. To quote Frank Slootman (former Snowflake CEO):\n“Strategy is overrated and execution is severely underrated. Mostly all companies plan well and mostly all companies fail at execution. Make execution the king in your company.”\n– Frank Slootman, Amp it Up\nExecution is key on the Growth Engineering team. We’ll need someone who relentlessly leads by example on execution and ships measurably impactful changes regularly to the user experience of Postman. We’ll progress and continuously improve towards achieving our goals and metrics and most importantly we’ll deliver an increasingly delightful product experience that developers love to use. You should expect to:\n\nOwn and deliver. Deliver improvements to the core product experience that help us achieve our goals around onboarding and activation\nDeliver little big changes. Deliver small, measured changes that meaningfully impact end users and successful activation of these users\n\nExperiment and identify winners. We have a great foundation of experimentation on the team and you will need to leverage and improve this foundation to ship A/B tested changes that we know have an impact on our goals.\n\nOwn end-to-end workflows. Own end-to-end and understand core workflows, driving measurable improvements to user experience particularly focused on first-time user experience (sign-up, onboarding, and beyond)\nDeeply understand the user. Collaborate and work with end users (developers!) using Postman to understand their core workflows and then use that knowledge to improve our product\nLearn and grow. Broaden your knowledge of the core product and the domain over time, starting with first-time UX but eventually branching out into driving improvement to deeper experiences on the Postman user’s journey, and\nCollaborate across boundaries and geographies. Collaborate on team processes to streamline collaboration across US and India team members\n\nAbout you\nMust have:\n\nAt least 3+ years of experience building frontend or full-stack projects and user experiences.\nTrack record of delivering impactful and engaging user experiences that delight users\nDeep expertise in building the modern web with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You likely have used libraries or frameworks like React or Next.js, but we care much more about the fundamentals than the tech stack.\nExcellent communication skills. We’re a remote-first team and we’re going to be moving fast together. Good communication is key.\nDetail oriented. We have to care about the details, and while we don’t expect you to be a designer, you need to care about the product experience that our teams are shipping.\nMeasure twice, cut once. We expect that you are analytical by nature and have experience in delivering features, improvements, and changes that leverage analytics tools (like LaunchDarkly) and experimentation techniques.\nCustomer obsession. As we are a core product with years of muscle memory, we need an engineer who is able and willing to leverage the voice of the customer to expedite decision making, develop conviction, and most importantly delight our user.\nBased in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nNice-to-have:\n\nExperience working with or using full-stack JavaScript / TypeScript\nExperience working in a React application with state management tools like MobX\nExperience working on B2B product and/or developer tools\n\nOur values\nAt Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency &amp; honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product. We are dedicated to delivering the best products we can.\nWhat else?\nIf the role is based in the greater San Francisco area, and the reasonably estimated salary for this role ranges from $177,607 to $240,292, plus a competitive equity package. Actual compensation is based on the candidate's skills, qualifications, and experience.

Our company currently uses two platforms, Wink and Blueprint, to manage customer data and payments. We need to ensure that all data from these platforms is correctly exported and reflected in QuickBooks without discrepancies...\n\nProblem:\n\n• When exporting payment data from Wink/Blueprint to QuickBooks, the data doesn’t match what is shown in QuickBooks. This appears to be an issue on the QuickBooks side and is fixable.\n\n• We need help designing a solution that automates the process of fixing this mismatch.\n\n• We also experience issues with payment data from private patients vs. government-funded patients, which results in incorrect data in QuickBooks due to different installment plans.\n\nThis is ideally automated using AI API",
